<h3 align="center">ChatGPT + Whisper API Voice Discord Bot</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The Discord bot is designed to interact with users in a voice channel. Upon joining a voice channel, the bot is capable of listening to users' spoken words and processing them as text. The bot utilizes voice recognition software to transcribe the speech into text, and then passes the text to ChatGPT for generating a response.
